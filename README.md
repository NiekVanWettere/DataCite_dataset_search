# DataCite_dataset_search

The Python script in this repository allows you to input a list of publication DOIs (in csv format, cf. the example file "test_inputfile.csv"), on the basis of which metadata of associated datasets is harvested via DataCite. Of course, associated datasets can only be discovered insofar the DataCite metadata of the dataset contains the publication DOI as related identifier.

This is only a draft version.
